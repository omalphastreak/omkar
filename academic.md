I completed my High School Education from VPM's Vidya Mandir, Dahisar, Mumbai prior to which I was a student at Sardar Vallabhai Patel Internation High School in Dahisar, Mumbai.

I have lived 19 years of my life in this wonderful city of Mumbai (which apparently never sleeps).

I then completed my Junior College at the Swami Ramkrishna Paramhans Junior College of Science , Govandi, Mumbai.

This was followed by me getting a rank of 1565 out of 150,000 students in the prestigious Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) Advanced for Engineering and a rank of 1214 out of around 1,300,000 students in JEE Mains. I was duly admitted into the Department of Energy Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT B). 

I am pursuing a Dual Degree (BTech + MTech) which includes a Bachelors in Energy Science and Engineering and Masters in Energy Systems Engineering. 

My research interests primarily include Energy Storage and Conversion systems, Metal Ion Batteries, Hybrid Electric Vehicles, Battery Management Systems and Electronics Reliablity.
